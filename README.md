## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Instagram:
1)Deletes messagesn without leaving a trace
2)Keeps me abreast on current affairs with visual representations.

Snapchat:
1)Cool Filters
2)I like the color lay0ut

Fifa Mobile:
1)I like the game
2)It allows me to see my favorite football layers

Chat GPT:
1)Easily accesible whwn I need to understand any concept ior topic.
2)I have phone interacting with it 

My objective is to create an application that enhances connections among individuals who possess mutual interests. This application will empower users to choose a particular topic of interest or even engage in conversations about random subjects, subsequently linking them with others based on their geographic location or timezone. Users will have the flexibility to opt for virtual or in-person meetings, as the app will grant them the freedom to select preferred individuals to connect with. For example, a university student in search of fellow classmates to discuss subjects like calculus 2 or collaborate with partners for app development projects will easily discover suitable matches through the app, simplifying the process of finding like-minded individuals.

## Notes

During the process of developing the app, I did not encounter any significant challenges. Looking ahead, I am eager to incorporate additional features into the app in the future.
