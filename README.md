## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Instagram:
1)Deletes messagesn without leaving a trace
2)Keeps me abreast on current affairs with visual representations.

Snapchat:
1)Cool Filters
2)I like the color lay0ut

Fifa Mobile:
1)I like the game
2)It allows me to see my favorite football layers

Chat GPT:
1)Easily accesible whwn I need to understand any concept ior topic.
2)I have phone interacting with it 


I want to make an app that links people with similar interests. It allows people to pick a topic or something random they want to talk to someomne about and it links them up based on their geographical location or timezone. It allows them to choose people to meet(Virtually or in person). For example a University Student who wants to meet with some students on subjects like calculus 2. Cn easily go to the app and find a match.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
